# Call-center-
Customer Service Analysis Report


##  üß© Project Overview
This project involves analyzing customer service call center data to evaluate performance, customer satisfaction, and agent effectiveness. The objective is to extract Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that provide insights into operational efficiency, customer sentiment, and agent productivity. The results will guide strategic decisions aimed at improving response quality, customer satisfaction, and overall service delivery across all communication channels and regions.

##  üóÇÔ∏è Data Source
The data was cleaned, transformed, and analyzed using Microsoft Excel and Power BI.

##  üìä Power BI for Visualization Dashboard
Power BI was used to build an interactive dashboard with the following components:

##  ‚ùì KPI Questions Addressed
1. What is the average CSAT Score across channels and agents?
2. Which agents and call centers have the highest resolution and satisfaction ratings?
3. How does response time affect customer satisfaction?
4. Which states and cities generate the most calls, and what are their sentiment trends?
5. What is the unanswered call rate and how can it be reduced?
6. Are certain channels more effective in handling customer complaints?

##  üîç Findings
1. Average CSAT Score was 3.9/5, with email and phone channels scoring highest.
2. Agent A and Agent D consistently achieved above 90% satisfaction ratings and resolved over 95% of their calls.
3. Average Response Time was 7.5 minutes; delays over 10 minutes correlated with lower CSAT and more negative sentiment.
4. The State of Lagos had the highest call volume, but also recorded the highest unresolved rate and negative sentiment.
5. 50% of calls came from three major reasons: service outage, billing errors, and account access issues.
6. Calls answered within 10 seconds had a 25% higher satisfaction rate than slower responses.
7. Unanswered call rate was 8%, with most dropped calls occurring during peak hours (12‚Äì2 PM).
8. Resolution rate stood at 88%, meaning 12% of customers left calls unresolved.


##  üí° Recommendations
1. Invest in staffing during peak hours to reduce unanswered calls and speed up response time.
2. Provide training for agents in low-performing centers, focusing on empathy, listening, and quick resolution.
3. Expand use of chat and email channels, which showed high satisfaction and lower operational load.
4. Use AI-powered auto-routing to direct calls to the most experienced agents or departments based on the reason.
5. Set a target SLA to answer calls within 10 seconds and respond to issues within 5 minutes.
6. Continuously monitor sentiment trends using text analytics to preempt escalations.

##  ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations
Some fields had missing values, such as satisfaction rating and Resolved status.
Subjective sentiment tagging may not always accurately reflect customer feelings.
Time zone differences in call timestamps were not standardized, possibly affecting time-based analysis.
Data was only for a limited time period and may not reflect seasonal trends.


##  ‚úÖ Conclusion
This project successfully utilized Power BI and data analytics to extract actionable insights from call center data. The findings emphasize the need for quicker responses, better training, and optimized channel usage to improve customer satisfaction. By focusing on performance KPIs and acting on real-time insights, the organization can enhance operational efficiency, agent accountability, and ultimately, customer loyalty.
